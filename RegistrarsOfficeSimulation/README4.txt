This is something I need to improve on for the final and I plan to do this with more practice. Code does not compile as I had a hard time using my queue in my ReadFile class.Sources:source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/destructors-c/source: http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/files/source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/destructors-c/source: http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/files/source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19259418/read-from-a-file-then-convert-from-to-intsource: http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/files/source: http://www.java2novice.com/data-structures-in-java/linked-list/doubly-linked-list/source: textbooksource: inclass notes
